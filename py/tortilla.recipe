Peel and slice the potatoes quite finely.
Peel and slice the onion finely.
Heat the oil in a medium sized, deepish frying pan at a medium temperarure.
When hot, add the potatoes, onions and seasoning. Cover and reduce the heat, stirring from time to time until the potatoes are cooked and slightly browned (about 20 minutes).
Meanwhile, beat the egg thoroughly in a bowl.
Drain off most of the excess oil and add the potato and onion mixture to the eggs.
Pour the whole lot back into the pan - there should be enough oil left to coat the bottom of the pan.
Increase the heat to medium again and cook the omelette until the bottom and sides have set.
Turn out the omelette onto a plate and slide it back into the pan upside down, so that the other side can be cooked. Alternatively, you can simply leave the omlette in the pan and place it under the grill until the top has set.
Once cooked, turn it out onto a plate and leave to cool. It is best served at room temperature.
