Chop the cabbage into bite-sized pieces - it will further reduce in size after dehydrating
Add the salt to about 250 ml of warm water and mix really well. the quantity is not that important as it will all be discarded.
Place the cabbage pieces in a large bowl, pour over the salt liquid and toss the cabbage in the mixture.
Cover with a tea-towel and leave at room temperature for about 5 hours, turning once or twice.
After 5 hours, using a colander, rinse the cabbage under a cold running tap to wash off all the salt. Drain and set to one side.
Mix the ground chilli flakes with about 5 or 6 tablespoons of water and mix to a paste.
Add the chilli paste, garlic, ginger, apple, pear and onion to a food processor with a blade and bland to a paste. Add a little water if it makes it easier to blend.
Add 2 tablespoons of nam pla to the cabbage together with the chopped spring onions and garlic-chilli paste.
Add 250 ml of cold water and wearing rubber gloves to protect your hands, mix really well so everything is evenly combined.
Pack the mixture into a sterilised kilner-type jar. Don't fill right to the top. You don't need as much room as pictured. It was the only jar I had, a smaller one would have done equally well.
Don't close the lid, just cover with a tea-towel and leave for 24 hours at room temperature to ferment.
After 24 hours, seal and store in the refrigerator where it will continue to ferment.
It should last for about 1 month, the longer it is kept, the more sour it will become. Apparently, the best kimchi to use for kimchi jjigae is old, sour kimchi.
